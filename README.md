# Documentation
This repository is aimed at providing documentation on and working examples targetting the MediaWiki 1.19+ API as well as the official [Wikia API](http://community.wikia.com/api/v1). Service API endpoints and other such things are also documented here though their examples may not be geared towards browser use and instead may require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
